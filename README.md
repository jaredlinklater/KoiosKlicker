KoiosKlicker relies on a Node.js Express web server, which can be hosted locally. The [set up section](#Web-Server-Setup) explains how to install the dependencies and run the server.

## Web Server Setup

Requirements
- Node.js (developed in v10.15.3)

Instructions
1. Clone repository to machine.
2. Navigate to 'src/'.
3. Run ```npm install``` and wait for module downloads to finish.
4. Run ```npm start```.
